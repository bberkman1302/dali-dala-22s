# Data Visualizations

Created using Tableu and React.js

All visualizations are hosted at:

I completed analysis on the data prior to creating the visualization, found in the 'PreViz-Analysis.ipynb' file.

## Visualization 1
In my first chart, I map total sales to their corresponding states. To represent the difference in sales between states, I use a gradient from light blue to dark blue, with darker colors representing the highest total sales. Using the filters I offer, you can toggle between years, regions, and client segments, to see how each of those variables affect the chart as a whole. As would be expected, states with larger populations, such as California, New York, and Texas, display the highest sales across year and segment.

## Visualization 2
In my second chart, I map total sales and revenue by month in order to see how seasonal changes affect the company's performance. Again, I offer toggles to switch between year and segment to see how those variables affect the data. The largest trend I noticed was that the sales tend to peak around the February/March area, then again around September, and once more around November, with a steady increase throughout the year. 

## Visualization 3
In my final chart, I display profit, sales, and profit margin across different categories and sub-categories on a bar chart (I offer a toggle to switch between each value type, as well as one to switch between years). It was interesting to note that certain products, such as tables, displayed high sales but exceptionally low profits. This trend seemed to carry across the furniture category as a whole.
